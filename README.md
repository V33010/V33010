# Hi, I'm Vivek

I’m a final-year Mechanical Engineering student who likes building practical software and figuring out how systems fit together. I spend a lot of time writing Python scripts, working in the terminal, and tinkering with backend logic. I especially enjoy working with APIs - connecting services, dealing with real-world data, and making different pieces talk to each other in a way that actually works. I like understanding things end-to-end and solving problems by keeping the code simple and solid.

I’m especially interested in problem-solving through code, developer experience, and projects that combine engineering thinking with software.
